# iKunnect

## Problem Domain: Chat System
Communication and socializing are vital to us because they're how we connect with others and feel like we belong. 
It's how we make friends, share experiences, and just enjoy life. So, our team decided to develop a chat system enabling
users to stay happy and connected through online chatting.

## High-Level Application Description
We aim to build a Chat System that will have the following features:
- send and receive messages
- edit/delete messages
- translation
- group chat & one-to-one messaging
- voice chat
- contact list
- chatbots

<p> We are also planning to develop multiple platforms for our chat system. In particular, our goal is to make it 
available on both mobile (Android) and web.</p>
