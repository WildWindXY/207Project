# Points for grading
- API Usage 
  
    Note: Unlike the previous "exploring APIs" assignment, it is fine if your team decides to use a Java library which wraps the actual API calls. Connecting directly to a database does not satisfy this requirement, but your team is welcome to use a database for some aspects of your project if you decide to do so.

- Only Java code 
  
  Note: The program your team is developing must be a Java program with a Java Swing GUI (similar to the grade-api and Login CA examples).
- Clean Architecture (under both server folder and client folder); please refer to the CA engine diagram as well as Week5 Lab code.

    Note: The program must attempt to adhere to Clean Architecture and the SOLID principles.
- Make sure everyone has their history (git log) so that we can count for contributions.
